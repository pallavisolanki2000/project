                <p><b>Bootstrap is a free and open-source 
                    tool collection for creating responsive
                    bsites and web applications. It is the
                     most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                     framework for developing responsive, 
                     mobile-first web sites. It solves many
                      problems which we had once, one of
                       which is the cross-browser compatibility 
                       issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect
                        for all the browsers (IE, Firefox and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens 
                    (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones).</b></p>
