            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is the most widely used
            language to write webPages. Hypertext refers to 
            the way in which Web web Pages  (html documents)
            are linkes together thus the link avaliable on a webPage
            is called Hypertext. As its name suggests. HTML is a markup Language.
            which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up"
            a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure is to display. 
            Originally HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure 
            of document likeheadings,paragraphs,list and to 
            forth to facilate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.
